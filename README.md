## **TCP Server**

Used for when the player logs in or logs out of the game (need safe and reliable connection to server) and when they choose what game they will play in and also what their character / class will be before the game begins.

1. Player information (username, password, email).
1. Player statistics (wins, loses).
1. Character faction and class.
1. Core UI information 
1. Character deaths / kills for scoreboard
	1. Stretch goals: Sending messages to other players in the game. Needs to be TCP as the information must be accurate.
	1. Stretch goals: Character creator information

## **UDP Server**

For the gameplay (less error checking but it is much faster which is required for a game running online with 40-80 people ideally at 60 frames per second). 
Information to be sent in data packets:

1. Transform information (location and rotation).
1. Player actions (attacks, heals, captures of areas like graveyards).
1. Buffs and debuffs (let the player know if they get a buff and how long it will last. Client will handle how the buff changes their actions).
1. Character health (to be displayed on other players UI and to check for validity).
	1. Stretch Goals: 

## **TCP or UDP**
1. Broadcasting tower / graveyard captures and captain / general deaths
1. NOTE: Logistics of sending information via TCP and UDP at the same time. Is it possible to connect players to 2 ports at the same time?

## **Database Information**
This section will list what we will need to store in the database

1. Player account information: username, email, password, etc.
1. Player gameplay statistics: wins / loses.
1. Character class statistics: health, actions, abilities.
1. Game version: What patch is the game running on, does the game need to be updated
1. Stretch goals: Able to pull character creator information


#Markup Text Testing

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. 

You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an h1
## This is an h2 tag
###### This is an h6 tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
   
   
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.


```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
